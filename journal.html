<p> entry 1... </p>
<p>
I have not done much yet, but coding so far has made me feel very creative and innovative lol. It feels like I am creating something like the things that I use every day. I've learned how the different tabs work. For example, the meta tab gives the browser more detail about how to create the page. I also learned about HTML tabs and style tabs. To move to a new tab, you have to close the previous tab by typing a greater than or less than sign, a backslash and then the name of whatever tab you are closing... ok bye now. this is fun

 <p> entry 2...</p>

 I am now figuring out how to code without asking for help or using my resources. I figured out how to make divs... somewhat confidently. I just finished making my home page and I personally think it's great. I think we're supposed to make a gif next, but i dont know how to do that. I have class tomorrow so i'll ask about it then ig. I'm trying to figure out how to add text in my big div at the top of the screen and how to change the margins between the different divs and the sides of my screen. 10/13/2022
